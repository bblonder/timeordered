Description: Methods for incorporating time into network analysis. Construction of time-ordered networks (temporal graphs). Shortest-time and shortest-path-length analyses. Resource spread calculations. Data resampling and rarefaction for null model construction. Reduction to time-aggregated networks with variable window sizes; application of common descriptive statistics to these networks. Vector clock latencies. Plotting functionalities.
